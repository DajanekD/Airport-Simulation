Airport Simulation
CSCE 2110-205
Group 5
Members : Riwaj Mainali
        : Dajanek Davis
        : Nathan Helgeson
        : Ashawini Patel

Major Functionalities : Implementation funtions, Input initial zone to vector and output initial zone is coded and handled by Riwaj Mainali and Ashawini Patel
                      : Domestic zone Functionalities is coded and handled by Ashawini Patel
                      : International Zone Functionalities is coded and handled by Nathan Helgeson
                      : Cargo Zone Functionalities is code and handled by Dajanek Davis
                      : Pollution(noise) Functionalities is coded and handled by Riwaj Mainali
                      : The final implementation which should be outputting the final structure of Airport after the timestamps, the total population and pollution(noise) of all different zones, outputting details of the manually entered boundary zone by the user, etc. is being coded and handled by all four members of this group { the person who was assigned to this Functionality has dropped the class after the project was assigned so therefore is being divided between the members of the group}
